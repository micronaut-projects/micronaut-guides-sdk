= Create and Connect a Micronaut Application to a MySQL Database

= {doctitle}

This guide describes how to create a database application using the Graal Development Kit for Micronaut (GDK). The application presents REST endpoints and stores data in a MySQL database using Micronaut Data.

== Create the Application

Create an application using the GDK Launcher.

. Open the link:/gdk/launcher/?advanced=true[GDK Launcher in advanced mode].

. Create a new project using the following selections.

** *Project Type*: _Application_ (Default)
** *Project Name*: _db-demo_
** *Base Package*: _com.example_ (Default)
** *Clouds*: _None_
** *Language*: _Java_ (Default)
** *Build Tool*: _Gradle (Groovy)_ or _Maven_
** *Test Framework*: _JUnit_ (Default)
** *Java Version*: _17_ (Default)
** *Micronaut Version*: (Default)
** *Cloud Services*: _Database_
** *Features*: _GraalVM Native Image_ (Default)
** *Sample Code*: _Yes_ (Default)
. Switch to the *Cloud Services* tab and make sure the *Database* service is selected. Deselect the other services. The Database service bundles all necessary features for a Micronaut database application: *Micronaut Data JDBC*, *Hikari JDBC Connection Pool*, *MySQL driver* and default config, *Flyway Database Migration*.

. Switch to *Selected* tab to verify the selection. You should see *Database* and the *GraalVM Native Image* packaging feature (selected by default) selected.

. Click *Generate Project*, then click *Download Zip*. The GDK Launcher creates an application with the default package `com.example` in a directory named _db-demo_. The application ZIP file will be downloaded to your default downloads directory. Unzip it, open it in your code editor, and proceed to the next steps.

Alternatively, use the link:/gdk/get-started/using-gdk-cli/[GDK CLI] as follows:

create-app:default[]

If you enable sample code generation, the GDK Launcher creates the main controller, repository interface, entity, service classes, and tests for you.
In the _micronaut-cli.yml_ file you can find all features packaged with the application:

[source,yml]
----
features: [app-name, data, data-jdbc, flyway, gdk-bom, gdk-database, gdk-license, gdk-platform-independent, graalvm, http-client-test, java, java-application, jdbc-hikari, junit, logback, maven, maven-enforcer-plugin, micronaut-aot, mysql, netty-server, properties, readme, serialization-jackson, shade, test-resources, validation]
----

Let's examine the project more closely.

include::asciidoc/commons/configure-datasources.adoc[]

If you deploy to, for example, Oracle MySQL Database, substitute the `driver-class-name` value with the Oracle Database Server (see link:micronaut-mysql-database-oci.md[Create and Connect a Micronaut Application to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure MySQL HeatWave Service]).

include::asciidoc/commons/configure-flyway.adoc[]

=== Domain Entity

include::asciidoc/commons/genre.adoc[]

=== Repository Interface

include::asciidoc/commons/genre-repository.adoc[]

=== Controller

include::asciidoc/commons/genre-controller.adoc[]

=== Service

include::asciidoc/commons/genre-service.adoc[]

=== Tests

include::asciidoc/commons/genre-controller-test.adoc[]

== Test the Application

include::asciidoc/commons/test-application.adoc[]

When the application is started locally&mdash;either under test or by running the application&mdash;resolution of the datasources URL is detected, the Test Resources service will start a local MySQL container, and inject the properties required to use this as the datasources.

For more information, see the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/#modules-databases-jdbc[JDBC section of the Test Resources documentation].

== Generate a Native Executable Using GraalVM

include::asciidoc/commons/graalvm-prereq.adoc[]

To generate a native executable, use the following command:

// TODO: command to build the native executable

Before running this native executable, you need to start and then connect to a MySQL database.

== Set the environment variables

include::asciidoc/commons/set-env-vars.adoc[]


== Connect to a MySQL Database

include::asciidoc/commons/connect-mysql-db.adoc[]


== Run the Application

Run the application from the native executable which starts the application on port 8080:

Save one genre and your `genre` database table will now contain an entry:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/genres" \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
        -d '{ "name": "music" }'
----

Access the `genres` endpoint exposed by the application:

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/genres/list
----

When you run the application, Micronaut Test Resources do not start a MySQL container because you have provided values for `datasources.default.*` properties

=== Summary

This guide demonstrated how to use the GDK to create a Micronaut database application that stores data in a MySQL database. You also learned how to package and run this application as a native executable.
