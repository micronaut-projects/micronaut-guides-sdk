Hibernate Validator is a reference implementation of the Validation API. Micronaut [has built-in support for validation of beans](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#beanValidation){:target="_blank"} that use `jakarta.validation` annotations. The necessary dependencies are included by default when creating a project.

The GDK Launcher created the main controller that exposes a resource with the common CRUD operations for you in _{{ include.parentDir }}src/main/java/com/example/controller/GenreController.java_:

<1> It is critical that any blocking I/O operations (such as fetching the data from the database) are offloaded to a separate thread pool that does not block the event loop.
<2> The class is defined as a controller with the [`@Controller`](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html){:target="_blank"} annotation mapped to the path `/genres`.
<3> Uses constructor injection to inject a bean of type `GenreRepository`.
<4> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres/{id}`, which attempts to show a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable (`id`).
<5> Maps a `PUT` request to `/genres/{id}/{name}`, which attempts to update a genre. This illustrates the use of URL path variables (`id` and `name`).
<6> Maps a `GET` request to `/genres/list`, which returns a list of genres. This mapping illustrates URL parameters being mapped to a single POJO.
<7> Maps a `POST` request to `/genres`, which attempts to create a new genre.
<8> Maps a `DELETE` request to `/genres/{id}`, which attempts to remove a genre. This illustrates the use of a URL path variable (`id`).
